# Unity Tools for Visual Studio Code
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TobiahZ/unity-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TobiahZ/unity-tools)
## What this extension is

This is an **unofficial** extention created by Tobiah Zarlez, and is not affiliated in any way with Unity Technologies. 

The goal of this extention is to add miscellaneous functionality to Visual Studio Code for Unity developers

## What this extension isn't

This is not a comprehensive set of tools for Unity development, nor does it provide any debugging features.

### Can you add XZY feature?

Possibly! Let me know, I'd love to hear your suggestions on what tools you'd like to see added to this collection.

## Feature list:
### Open Unity Documentation
Use the pallet command "Open Unity Documentation" (`Cmd+'` on OSX or `Ctrl+'` on Windows and Linux) to open the Unity Documentation for the currently selected class.

### Search Unity Documentation
Use the pallet command "Search Unity Documentation" (Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+'` on OSX or `Ctrl+Shift+'` on Windows and Linux) where you can quickly enter whatever you want to search for.

### Open VSCode Unity Documentation
Added the pallet command "Open VSCode Unity Documentation" to open the [Unity Development with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/runtimes/unity) page on the Visual Studio Code Documentation.

### Get Unity plug-in from the Unity Asset Store
Added the pallet command "Get Unity plug-in from the Unity Asset Store" to open [dotBunny's Unity plug-in](https://github.com/dotBunny/VSCode/) on the [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/jmM). Afterwards, will display a message with a link to the [How-To](https://github.com/dotBunny/VSCode/blob/master/HOWTO.pdf) and the Git repo for the project.
