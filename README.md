# Processing for Visual Studio Code
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TobiahZ/processing-vscode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TobiahZ/processing-vscode)
## What this extension is

This is a Visual Studio Code extension created by Tobiah Zarlez to add Processing language support.

## What this extension isn't

This extension does not allow you to debug Java or Processing projects.

### Can you add XZY feature?

Possibly! Let me know, I'd love to hear your suggestions.

## Feature list:
### Syntax highlighting

Open any .pde file, or simply choose "Processing" from the drop down menu in the bottom right corner.

### Snippets

Once the language has been set, you will see code snippets pop up automatically as you type!

## Credits

Syntax highlighting and snippets code based on the [Processing Sublime Text plugin](https://github.com/b-g/processing-sublime).
